**Project Purpose** <br/>
This is a senior engineering design project that I have done with my teammates at MechSE of UIUC in Spring 2018. 

**Project Objective** <br/>
To create a prototype that demonstrates automatic control of the pH of water while maintaining a continuous flow.

**Project Deliverables** <br/>
1.	A physical system including electronics, container, pumps, chemicals for pH adjusting, etc. <br/>
2.	Software for water pH control and software for water flow rate control. <br/>
3.	A convenient Graphic User Interface. <br/>

For further information about the control and GUI implementation, please find the code [here](https://github.com/diditong).
